# Addons

The abap2UI5 framework is designed with a minimal system footprint, including only essential features by default. However, if you need additional functionality, you can easily install more add-ons:

1. Runtime Typed Data [(link)](/addons/srtti)
2. Layout-Variant-Management [(link)](/addons/layout)
3. Popup [(link)](/addons/popup)
4. Launchpad KPIs [(link)](/addons/kpi)
5. Remote App Calls [(link)](/addons/rfc)
6. JS Libraries [(link)](/addons/ext_js)
7. Apps & more [(link)](/addons/apps)
