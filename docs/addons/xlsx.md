No worries! No one wants to reinvent the wheel and write the 1001st blog post about ABAP and XLSX. ;) <br>

As abap2UI5 is a pure ABAP framework, you can easily use the fantastic project abap2XLSX to upload and download XLSX files and display the content in UI5 tables. In the cloud, you can use the new XCO API for XLSX handling. This add-on provides some basic examples and APIs to give you an idea of how to use XLSX files with abap2UI5.
