# XLSX

<i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i> [XLSX Addon on GitHub](https://github.com/abap2UI5-addons/xlsx)

Since abap2UI5 is a pure ABAP framework, you can easily leverage the existing XLSX handling features of your ABAP system. <br>

In ABAP Cloud, you can use the new APIs provided by the `XCO_CP_XLSX`classes. <br>

For classic ABAP, there are several ways to handle XLSX files. However, to stay on the open-source path, consider using the excellent project [abap2xlsx](https://github.com/abap2xlsx) — you’ll find no easier solution. <br>

With abap2UI5, you only need to implement a file upload and transfer the contents of the XLSX file into an internal ABAP table or vice versa. This add-on provides APIs and examples to simplify your development. <br>
