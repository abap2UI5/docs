# Runtime Typed Data with S-RTTI

<i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i> [S-RTTI Repository](https://github.com/sandraros/S-RTTI)

abap2UI5 serializes your app instances to ensure stateless behavior in client communication. Unfortunately, the sap standard transformation features are limited, for example not supporting local types created at runtime. Fortunately the project S-RTTI fills this gap. Install it and make full use of dynamic popups, typing, and runtime-created apps.
