# abapGit

This project uses [abapGit](https://github.com/abapGit/abapGit) to manage version control and distribute its code efficiently.

#### Git Client

All project artifacts are developed directly in an ABAP system and stored in a GitHub repository via abapGit.  
This setup makes the project easy to install on any customer system. Updates are distributed immediately and can be pulled by any user at any time.

#### Apps as abapGit Artifacts

In addition to the abap2UI5 core framework, all abap2UI5 apps are also stored as ABAP classes as abapGit-managed objects.  
This enables installation via abapGitâ€” no manual deployment required, unlike traditional UI5 apps.

You can also install multiple abap2UI5 apps with a single abapGit pull. This also works seamlessly in ABAP Cloud environments, reducing deployment overhead.

#### Contribution

Contributions are welcome and easily managed through Pull Requests on GitHub.  
Simply create a new pull request and commit your changes using abapGit.
