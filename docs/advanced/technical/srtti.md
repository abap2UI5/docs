# S-RTTI

In abap2UI5, you don’t necessarily need to define your data model at design time. Instead, you can work with generic data references and apply typing dynamically at runtime based on your program logic. This is particularly useful for scenarios like tables, where different columns and table types may be displayed depending on user input.

abap2UI5 serializes app instances to ensure stateless behavior in client communication. However, SAP’s standard transformation features are limited and do not support data references with local types created at runtime. 

To overcome this limitation, the project [S-RTTI](https://github.com/sandraros/S-RTTI) is integrated into abap2UI5 under the `z2ui5` namespace.


#### Standard Transformation
With fully typed data at design time, the standard SAP transformation works out of the box:

```abap
CLASS z2ui5_cl_app DEFINITION PUBLIC.

  PUBLIC SECTION.
    INTERFACES z2ui5_if_app.
    DATA mr_tab TYPE REF TO data.

ENDCLASS.

CLASS z2ui5_cl_app IMPLEMENTATION.

  METHOD z2ui5_if_app~main.

    TYPES:
      BEGIN OF ty_row,
        title TYPE string,
        value TYPE string,
        descr TYPE string,
      END OF ty_row.
    TYPES ty_t_tab TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF ty_row WITH EMPTY KEY.

    CREATE DATA mr_tab TYPE ty_t_tab.

    FIELD-SYMBOLS <tab> TYPE ty_t_tab.
    ASSIGN mr_tab->* TO <tab>.
    <tab> = VALUE #(
        ( title = 'entry 01'  value = 'red'  descr = 'this is a description' )
        ( title = 'entry 02'  value = 'blue' descr = 'this is a description' ) ).

    client->message_box_display( `this works only with S-RTTI` ).

  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.
```

#### Transformation with S-RTTI
When working with data typed dynamically at runtime using local types, S-RTTI is required:
```abap
CLASS z2ui5_cl_app DEFINITION PUBLIC.

  PUBLIC SECTION.
    INTERFACES z2ui5_if_app.
    DATA mr_tab TYPE REF TO data.

ENDCLASS.

CLASS z2ui5_cl_app IMPLEMENTATION.

  METHOD z2ui5_if_app~main.

    DATA(o_struct_desc) = cl_abap_structdescr=>describe_by_name( 'USR01' ).
    DATA(o_table_desc) = cl_abap_tabledescr=>create(
                                                     p_line_type  = CAST #( o_struct_desc )           " Spalten
                                                     p_table_kind = cl_abap_tabledescr=>tablekind_std " Tabellentyp STANDARD TABLE
                                                     p_unique     = abap_false                        " NON-UNIQUE KEY
                                                   ).

    DATA: o_table TYPE REF TO data.
    CREATE DATA mr_tab TYPE HANDLE o_table_desc.

    client->message_box_display( `this works only with S-RTTI` ).

    DATA(view) = z2ui5_cl_xml_view=>factory( ).
    DATA(page) = view->page( 'abap2UI5 - Selection-Screen Example' ).
    client->view_display( page->stringify( ) ).

  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.

```
#### Functionality
With generic types, the standard transformation throws an error. abap2UI5 resolves this issue by looping over all attributes and applying a workaround:
- For each generic attribute, a separate serialization is performed using S-RTTI beforehand.
- The data is stored in a separate table.
- The variable is initialized, and the standard SAP transformation is called again.
- On the way back, the object is recreated, and the table content is deserialized back into the attributes.

This approach ensures compatibility with dynamic types while maintaining a robust transformation process. This process works in the background and independently of the two app implementations above.
