# abap2UI5 Cloud Readiness

## What is ABAP Cloud and Cloud Readiness?

**ABAP Cloud** is SAP's strategic development model for building modern, cloud-native applications and extensions on the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) and in S/4HANA Cloud environments. It is based on a restricted ABAP language scope and mandates the use of **released APIs** only. This model follows the **Clean Core** principle, aiming to decouple extensions from the SAP core to ensure long-term upgrade compatibility.

**Cloud Readiness** means that an ABAP project:

- Uses only released SAP APIs (released objects)  
- Complies with the restricted **ABAP for Cloud Development** language scope  
- Avoids unauthorized modifications or direct access to SAP core tables  
- Is managed via abapGit or Git-compatible workflows  
- Can run on Steampunk (standalone) or Embedded Steampunk systems (e.g., S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition)

## Why is abap2UI5 Cloud Ready?

**abap2UI5** fully meets the requirements of a cloud-compliant ABAP project:

- It is written entirely using **ABAP for Cloud Development**, with no use of restricted language features or unreleased objects.  
- It only relies on internally defined classes or released APIs.  
- The complete codebase is managed through **abapGit** and can be imported into Steampunk systems.  
- It requires no core modifications, making it fully **Clean Core compliant**.  
- UI5 apps are based on a static, generic frontend, while all logic and UI behavior is driven from the ABAP backend.

> âœ… **Conclusion**: abap2UI5 is cloud-ready, clean-core compliant, and supports modern, upgrade-safe development practices.
