# abap2UI5 Cloud Readiness

#### What is ABAP Cloud and Cloud Readiness?

ABAP Cloud is SAP's strategic development model for building modern, cloud-native applications and extensions on the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) and in S/4HANA Cloud environments. It is based on a restricted ABAP language scope and mandates the use of **released APIs** only. This model follows the **Clean Core** principle, aiming to decouple extensions from the SAP core to ensure long-term upgrade compatibility.

Cloud Readiness means that an ABAP project:

- Uses only released SAP APIs (released objects)  
- Complies with the restricted **ABAP for Cloud Development** language scope  
- Avoids any modifications or direct access to SAP tables

Such developments can run on the standalone BTP ABAP Environment (Steampunk) or the Embedded ABAP Environment (e.g., S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition). Even if still operating on ECC, projects built this way are future-proof and ensure safe, low-effort migration to cloud environments without rework or additional costs.

#### Why is abap2UI5 Cloud Ready?

abap2UI5 fully meets the criteria of a cloud-compliant ABAP project:

- It is written entirely using **ABAP for Cloud Development**, with no use of restricted language features or unreleased objects
- It only relies on internally defined classes or released APIs
- It requires no core modifications, making it fully **Clean Core compliant**.  
- The UI5 frontend is a static UI5 freestyle app

abap2UI5 is cloud-ready by design, Clean Core compliant, and supports modern, upgrade-safe development practices.

#### Do I Have to Use RAP to Be Cloud Ready?

The RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP) is SAP's official model for building cloud-ready ABAP applications. It is based on:

- CDS Views for data modeling (design-time)
- Behavior Definitions for logic and validations
- OData Services for standardized CRUD operations
- Fiori Elements for automatic UI generation

While RAP is tightly integrated with ABAP Cloud, it is not mandatory. Cloud readiness depends on technical compliance—not on the use of RAP. Any solution that adheres to SAP’s released APIs and language scope is considered cloud-ready, even without RAP.

#### Conclusion

Even without using RAP, abap2UI5 is fully cloud-compliant and aligned with SAP’s Clean Core principles. It is cloud-ready by design, future-proof, and supports upgrade-safe development across both standalone and embedded ABAP Cloud environments.
