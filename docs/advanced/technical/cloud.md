# abap2UI5 Cloud Readiness

#### What is ABAP Cloud and Cloud Readiness?

ABAP Cloud is SAP's strategic development model for building modern, cloud-native applications and extensions on the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) and in S/4HANA Cloud environments. It is based on a restricted ABAP language scope and mandates the use of **released APIs** only. This model follows the **Clean Core** principle, aiming to decouple extensions from the SAP core to ensure long-term upgrade compatibility.

Cloud Readiness means that an ABAP project:

- Uses only released SAP APIs (released objects)  
- Complies with the restricted **ABAP for Cloud Development** language scope  
- Avoids unauthorized modifications or direct access to SAP core tables  
- Is managed via abapGit or Git-compatible workflows  
- Can run on Steampunk (standalone) or Embedded Steampunk systems (e.g., S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition)

#### Why is abap2UI5 Cloud Ready?

abap2UI5 fully meets the requirements of a cloud-compliant ABAP project:

- It is written entirely using **ABAP for Cloud Development**, with no use of restricted language features or unreleased objects.  
- It only relies on internally defined classes or released APIs.  
- The complete codebase is managed through **abapGit** and can be imported into Steampunk systems.  
- It requires no core modifications, making it fully **Clean Core compliant**.  
- UI5 apps are based on a static, generic frontend, while all logic and UI behavior is driven from the ABAP backend.

abap2UI5 is cloud-ready, clean-core compliant, and supports modern, upgrade-safe development practices.

#### Do I Have to Use RAP to Be Cloud Ready?

The RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP) is SAP's official architecture for building cloud-ready ABAP applications. It is based on:

- CDS Views for data modeling (design-time)
- Behavior Definitions for logic and validations
- OData Services for standardized CRUD operations
- Fiori Elements for automatic UI generation

While tightly integrated with ABAP Cloud, RAP is not **mandatory**. Cloud readiness depends on technical compliance, not on using RAP specifically. Any solution that respects SAP’s released APIs and language scope can be considered cloud-ready—even without RAP.

#### Conclusion

Despite not using RAP, abap2UI5 remains fully cloud-compliant and adheres to SAP’s Clean Core principles. It is lightweight, low-barrier, and designed for longevity—clean-core and cloud-ready by design.
