#### abap2UI5 Apps as abapGit Artefacts
In addition to the **abap2UI5** project, all developed **abap2UI5** apps are also stored as **abapGit** objects. This allows you to manage them in any Git repository. As a result, **abap2UI5** apps do not require manual deployment like traditional **UI5** apps. You can install multiple **abap2UI5** apps with a single **abapGit** pull. This also works seamlessly in **ABAP Cloud** contexts, reducing deployment effort and keeping everything centralized in the backend.
