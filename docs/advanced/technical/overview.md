# Technology Evolution: From ITS to abap2UI5

This page explains how SAP UI technologies have evolved over the years — from classic Server-Side Rendering approaches like **ITS** and **Web Dynpro**, to client-side SPAs with **UI5 Freestyle** and **RAP**, and finally to the **Over-the-Wire** paradigm of **abap2UI5**.

## 1. ITS Mobile: Bringing SAP GUI to the Web (2000+)
The **Internet Transaction Server (ITS)** was SAP’s first step to bring SAP GUI screens (Dynpro) to the web. ITS Mobile converts classical Dynpro screens into basic HTML pages.

- Pure **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: HTML is generated on the server for every interaction.
- Optimized for simple mobile devices (e.g., warehouse scanners).
- Focus on reusing existing Dynpro logic for web & mobile use cases.
- Still used today for specific legacy scenarios.

## 2. Web Dynpro ABAP: Structured Web Applications (2003+)
**Web Dynpro ABAP** introduced a component-based UI framework for web applications.

- UI definitions are created in ABAP (Views, Context, Controllers).
- Still **Server-Side Rendering**: UI is built on the server, rendered as HTML in the browser.
- Suitable for transactional business applications.
- More structured and modular than ITS, but limited for modern UX expectations.

## 3. UI5 Freestyle: Full Client-Side SPAs (2010+)
With the advent of smartphones and richer web experiences, **UI5 Freestyle** was introduced.

- Based on **JavaScript, XML Views, and UI5 Controls**.
- Follows a **Single Page Application (SPA)** architecture.
- Full control over frontend behavior and look & feel.
- Enables highly customized, interactive applications.
- Requires dedicated frontend development expertise.

## 4. RAP / Fiori Elements: Standardized Backend-Driven SPA (2019+)
The **RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP)** and **Fiori Elements** aim to standardize application development.

- Developers define **CDS Annotations** in ABAP to describe UI behavior.
- The UI5 Fiori Elements runtime in the browser renders the app as a **SPA**.
- Simplifies UI development by using predefined floorplans and templates.
- Still SPA complexity (OData Metadata handling, UI5 runtime in browser).

## 5. abap2UI5: Over-the-Wire for SAP (2023+)
**abap2UI5** brings the simplicity of the **Over-the-Wire** concept to SAP UI5 development.

- The ABAP backend defines **UI5 XML Views** and **JSON ViewModels**.
- A static UI5 frontend dynamically renders these definitions.
- No custom JavaScript development required.
- Combines backend-driven development with UI5 flexibility.
- Aligns with SAP's "Keep the Core Clean" strategy.

## Comparison Table

| Feature | ITS Mobile | Web Dynpro (ABAP) | UI5 Freestyle | RAP (Fiori Elements) | abap2UI5 |
|----------|------------|------------------|---------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Era** | 2000+ | 2003+ | 2010+ | 2019+ | 2023+ |
| **UI Definition** | Dynpro Screens | ABAP Component Views | JavaScript + XML Views | CDS Annotations | ABAP Class (XML View & JSON ViewModel) |
| **Data Flow** | Dynpro → HTML | Context Nodes | OData / Custom APIs | OData V4: Metadata & Data | View + ViewModel via JSON |
| **UI Rendering** | Server-Side Rendering (SSR) | Server-Side Rendering (SSR) | Client-side SPA | Client-side SPA | Over-the-Wire |
| **Frontend Code** | HTML generated by ITS | HTML/JS generated by ABAP runtime | Custom UI5 App (SPA) | UI5 Fiori Elements SPA Runtime | Static generic UI5 Shell |
| **Developer Focus** | ABAP Dynpro | ABAP | ABAP + JavaScript | ABAP | ABAP only |
| **Complexity (Frontend)** | Very Low | Low | High | Medium | Very Low |
| **Typical Use Cases** | Mobile terminals, legacy apps | Transactional SAP apps | Custom, interactive dashboards | Standard CRUD apps with templates | CRUD-heavy apps, forms, dashboards |

## Summary: Why abap2UI5?

- **ITS & Web Dynpro**: Full SSR, but limited UX flexibility.
- **UI5 Freestyle**: Richer UIs, but introduce SPA complexity
- **RAP**: Limited Felxibility, CDS and UI Annotations
- **abap2UI5**: Bridges the gap — backend-driven like ITS/Web Dynpro, but with modern UI5 rendering & Over-the-Wire efficiency.

For typical business applications (forms, tables, dashboards), abap2UI5 offers a pragmatic and maintainable alternative to SPA-heavy approaches — fully in line with SAP UI5 and clean core principles.
