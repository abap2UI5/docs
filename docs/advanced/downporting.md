# Downporting

abap2UI5 works out of the box with ABAP version 750. If you are on a lower release, you can install the downported version, it is compatible down to R/3 NetWeaver >702. <br>

#### Branch

Just install the project with the `702` branch:
| Branch    | System                | 
|-----------| ----------------------------|
| main     | S/4 Public Cloud, BTP ABAP Environment, S/4 Private Cloud, S/4 On-Premise, R/3 NetWeaver >750 |
| 702  |  R/3 NetWeaver >702   |

The samples and some other repositories also exist with a dowmported version, always just check out if a `702` branch exists.
