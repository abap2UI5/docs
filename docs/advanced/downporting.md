# Downporting

abap2UI5 works out of the box with ABAP version 750. If you are using a lower release, you can install the downported version, which is compatible with R/3 NetWeaver >702.

#### Branch
To install the project on an older system, use the `702` branch:
| Branch    | System                | 
|-----------| ----------------------------|
| main     | S/4 Public Cloud, BTP ABAP Environment, S/4 Private Cloud, S/4 On-Premise, R/3 NetWeaver >750 |
| 702  |  R/3 NetWeaver >702   |

Some sample projects and additional repositories also have a downported version. Simply check whether a `702` branch is available.
