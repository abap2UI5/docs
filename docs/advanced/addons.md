# Addons

The abap2UI5 project focuses solely on the following core functionalities:
* Rendering views
* Event handling
* Data exchange

This approach reduces complexity, making the project easier to maintain and improve. However, if you need additional functionality, you can install addons for common features.

#### Addons
Explore the [abap2UI5-addons](https://github.com/abap2UI5-addons) to find the functionality you need. Available features include:
- Layout-variant management, similar to classic SAP GUI selection screens or ALV development
- Table maintenance tools
- Integration with third-party libraries like Chart.js for enhanced visualization
- ...

And many more.

#### Contribution
