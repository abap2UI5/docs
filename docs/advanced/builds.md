# Builds

If you use abap2UI5 extensively, you may consider creating your own build by defining a custom namespace and including the specific addons you need:
- Use abap2UI5 in the `z2ui5` namespace for improvements and pull requests, while maintaining a separate namespace for your production version.
- Install multiple instances of abap2UI5 and upgrade each version at its own pace.
- Create a customized abap2UI5 build with frontend components and addons tailored to your specific scenario.
