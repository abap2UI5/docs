# View
In abap2UI5, the output is generated by importing a UI5 XML View. Here’s a basic example:
```abap
METHOD z2ui5_if_app~main.

    client->view_display( 
        |<mvc:View xmlns="sap.m" xmlns:core="sap.ui.core" xmlns:mvc="sap.ui.core.mvc" | &
        |          displayBlock="true" height="100%">| &
        |  <Shell>| &
        |     <Page title="My title">| &
        |         <Text text="My text"/>| &
        |     </Page>| &
        |  </Shell>| &
        |</mvc:View>| ).

ENDMETHOD.
```
You can use any UI5 control available in the UI5 SDK. However, working with XML can become cumbersome. A more efficient approach is to use the `Z2UI5_CL_XML_VIEW` class. Here's an improved version of the code using this class:
```abap
  METHOD z2ui5_if_app~main.

    client->view_display(
        z2ui5_cl_xml_view=>factory(
            )->shell(
                )->page( 'My title'
                    )->Text( 'My text' 
        )->stringify( ) ).

  ENDMETHOD.
```
Check the API of `Z2UI5_CL_XML_VIEW` and leverage code completion to easily find the correct controls and properties. Additionally, it’s recommended to explore the sample repository, which contains pre-written XML examples for most use cases. These examples are available for easy copy-pasting and can be adjusted to suit your specific needs.

Currently, this setup is quite static. In the next section, we will explore how to bind and exchange data between the view and the app logic.
