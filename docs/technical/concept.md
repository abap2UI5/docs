# Key Concept: UI5 Over-the-Wire

ðŸš§ Under Construction ðŸš§ 
 
This page explains the basic architecture behind abap2UI5. The core idea is based on a pattern called _HTML Over-the-Wire_, adapted for the SAP technology stack. It simplifies UI5 development by moving both UI rendering and application logic entirely to the ABAP backend.

#### What is HTML Over-the-Wire?

_HTML Over-the-Wire_ describes a server-centric web architecture in which the user interface is generated on the server and sent to the browser as ready-to-render HTML.

Instead of building and maintaining complex JavaScript frontends, managing APIs, and exchanging JSON, the server handles everything â€” from business logic to UI generation. The browser simply receives and renders HTML fragments. This approach eliminates the need for client-side MVC frameworks, data transformation layers, and frontend deployment processes [(1)](https://signalvnoise.com/svn3/html-over-the-wire/):

> You can write fast, modern, responsive web applications by generating your HTML on the server, and delivering that directly to the browser. You donâ€™t need JSON as an in-between format. You donâ€™t need client-side MVC frameworks. You donâ€™t need complicated bundling and transpiling pipelines.

> This is what HTML Over The Wire is all about. Itâ€™s a celebration of the simplicity in HTML as the format for carrying data and presentation together, whether this is delivered on the first load or with subsequent dynamic updates.

In this architecture the initial request delivers JavaScript and CSS, Subsequent interactions trigger AJAX calls to fetch HTML fragments and the browser inserts these fragments into the DOM without reloading the full page [(2)](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/fiori-like-web-app-development-in-pure-abap-with-htmx-and-fundamental/ba-p/13500763):

<br/>
  <em> HTML "Over the Wire" Lifecycle</em>
</p>

This results in a clean and lightweight frontend â€” a pure rendering layer â€” while all logic remains under full control of the backend.

Several modern frameworks follow this pattern:
* [htmx](https://htmx.org) Progressive enhancement via HTML partials (Any web stack)
* [Hotwire (Turbo)](https://hotwired.dev) HTML-over-the-wire for Rails apps (Ruby on Rails)
* [Phoenix LiveView](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view) Real-time UI with server rendering (Elixir/Phoenix)
* [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com) Server-driven UI components in PHP  (Laravel/PHP)
* [Unpoly](https://unpoly.com) Simplified partial page updates (Any web stack)


#### How is this different from classic Server Side Rendering?

In the early days of web development, Server-Side Rendering (SSR) was the standard. Every user interaction triggered a full-page reload, and the server responded with a complete HTML document. Within the SAP ecosystem, this approach was seen in technologies like ITS Mobile and SAP GUI for HTML.

The emergence of Single-Page Applications (SPAs) shifted the rendering logic to the client. SPAs fetch raw data â€” through OData services in SAP systems â€” and dynamically construct the UI in the browser using JavaScript frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue. SAP adopted this paradigm with the introduction of UI5 in 2010.

However, SPAs come with their own set of challenges: complex API layers, separation of frontend and backend development teams, and intricate build and deployment pipelines. As a counter-approach, HTML Over-the-Wire reintroduces a server-driven approach to UI updates:
- The server sends only HTML fragments, not entire pages, the browser updates specific parts of the DOM
- The frontend remains simple and declarative, all logic and artifacts reside in the backend

Architectural Comparison:

| Approach      | Data Flow                        | Rendering Location         | Period           |
|---------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| **SSR**       | Full-page HTML responses         | Entirely on the server    | 1990s â€“ 2010s    |
| **SPA**       | Raw data (JSON), client builds UI| Client-side (JavaScript)  | 2010s â€“ today    |
| **Over-the-Wire** | HTML fragments for partial updates | Server renders, browser inserts | 2020s (re-emerging) |

#### How UI5 Freestyle Works

UI5 freestyle apps follow the Single Page Application (SPA) model. All UI artifacts are stored on the frontend, while the backend provides data via OData â€” typically based on CDS Views or custom ABAP implementations. Both rendering and logic execution take place entirely in the browser:

<p align="center">
  <img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ba09f8b-b8ad-48e3-9693-e12feeb94aed" />
<br/>
  <em>Freestyle - ABAP Stack delivers only Data</em>
</p>

Since UI5 is a client-side rendering framework, the HTML output cannot be generated on the backend and sent to the client. Instead, HTML is produced in the browser using the UI5 framework and its built-in render.

#### Sending Views from Backend

Fortunately, UI5 has a defining characteristic that allows us to shift part of the view generation to the backend. Normally, each view is defined in XML â€” the so-called UI5 XML View. The UI5 framework uses this XML definition, combined with data from the backend, to render HTML in the browser.

<p align="center">
<img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9bf8f85-54e7-476d-be87-2cd028334d2d" />
<br/>
  <em>UI5 Freestyle â€“ The browser renders HTML based on XML View and backend data</em>
</p>

abap2UI5 now introduces a subtle but important shift: what if the backend also delivers the XML View?

While HTML rendering still happens on the frontend, both the view definition and the corresponding data are now delivered from the backend:

<p align="center">
    <img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec1ac3f8-65fb-4155-84f6-1ec61a088c40" />
<br/>
  <em>abap2UI5 â€“ The browser renders HTML based on XML View and data fully delivered by the backend</em>
</p>

The UI5 application remains a single-page application (SPA), but its role changes: it becomes a pure rendering engine for server-defined views and data. How can we establish user interaction in this new scenario?

####  Handling Frontend Events in the Backend

To enable user interaction, a minimal static UI5 freestyle app is delivered with the initial HTTP request. This app contains just enough logic to forward frontend events to the backend. The interaction model is inspired by the classic PAI/PBO pattern from SAP GUI applications.

When the user triggers an event (e.g., button press), the event informaton is sent to the backend, where an ABAP class determines the next step. All business logic resides entirely in the backend:

<p align="center">
<img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecd6e798-b6f6-4816-89ca-90f20647eb04" />
<br/>
  <em>subtitle</em>
</p>

In UI5 Freestyle apps, each application required a dedicated set of frontend artifacts:

<p align="center">
<img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b5c9b5b-3014-489f-90b4-55222744ba8a" />
<br/>
  <em>UI5 Freestyle â€“ multiple frontend artifacts per app</em>
</p>

With abap2UI5, the frontend becomes a static UI5 app shared across all applications, while all views and logic are defined and maintained in the backend. Each app is represneted by an ABAP class where the views are generated and the events are handled:

<p align="center">
<img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79c7c6be-6424-4c33-ab3c-9c7799a74747" />
<br/>
  <em>abap2UI5 â€“ One static frontend, all views and logic in ABAP</em>
</p>

Furthermore every UI5 app becomes a complete ABAP backend project managed through abapGit, eliminating the need for separate frontend deployments entirely.

#### Editable Data Exchange

So far, weâ€™ve focused on how to display data using a backend-driven approach. But how can user input and changes made in the frontend be processed? If we were to continue relying on OData, any updates would typically be routed into the OData service layerâ€”bypassing the ABAP class that also defines the view in abap2UI5. 

Let's take a look to the UI5 Freeestyle feature and concept of view models. In UI5 Freestyle, view models (often JSON models) are used to bind attributes such as visible or enabled and binded to passgenau um control eigenschaften eines views in model attribute zu hinterlegen:

<p align="center">
<img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df92711f-abd1-4bfd-b84a-268bb452503f" />
<br/>
  <em>UI5 â€“ View model bindings for visibility and state</em>
</p>

Here comes the second key shift: abap2UI5 nakes heavy use of View Models, instead of binding to OData it explicitly assembled in the backend after every request a dedicated view model for the actual view. This model is sent together with the view to the frontend:

<p align="center">
<img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/461f08c2-0f0f-424e-a7f8-008af3610258" />
<br/>
  <em>abap2UI5 â€“ View and model are delivered together by the backend</em>
</p>

This means CDS Views and OData services are no longer consumed directly on the frontend. Instead, both the view and its data model are sent from the backend in a single response. Changes made in the UI can be sent back by sending the u0pdated View Model in the baclkend again â€” no OData routing required.

But App developers donâ€™t need to manually configure UI models or bindings. abap2UI5 bietet dies komplette logik im hintergrund an und als app anwender muss man lediglich die attribute seine klasse vie binding methode fÃ¼r den tranfer and frontend freigeben.

A typical response from the backend now includes both the XML View and its View Model:
```json
{
   "S_FRONT": {
      "APP": "Z2UI5_CL_APP_HELLO_WORLD",
      "ID": "AD94A1CC76F145E986F4DFCB7D183CC5",
      "PARAMS": {
         "S_VIEW": {
            "XML": " <mvc:View displayBlock=\"true\" height=\"100%\" xmlns=\"sap.m\" xmlns:core=\"sap.ui.core\" ..."
         }
      }
   },
   "MODEL": {
      "XX": {
         "NAME": "test"
      }
   }
}
```
And the associated XML View looks like this:
```xml
<mvc:View xmlns="sap.m" xmlns:core="sap.ui.core" xmlns:form="sap.ui.layout.form" xmlns:mvc="sap.ui.core.mvc" displayBlock="true" height="100%">
  <Shell>
    <Page title="abap2UI5 - Hello World">
      <form:SimpleForm editable="true">
        <form:content>
          <Title text="Make an input here and send it to the server..."/>
          <Label text="Name"/>
          <Input value="{/XX/NAME}"/>
          <Button press=".eB(['BUTTON_POST'])" text="post"/>
        </form:content>
      </form:SimpleForm>
    </Page>
  </Shell>
</mvc:View>
```

This architecture results in a clean and unified application model:

#### Efficient Partial HTML Updates

A central feature of the HTML Over the Wire approach is that only the affected parts of the page are updated, rather than the entire document. Can this be achieved in UI5?

While changing the entire XML View in UI5 typically results in a full re-render, abap2UI5 makes partial updates possible by updating only the view model. This allows UI5 to efficiently update only the relevant UI controls through data bindingâ€”without rebuilding the entire view. 

Consider this example:

```abap
CLASS z2ui5_cl_demo_app_025 DEFINITION PUBLIC CREATE PUBLIC.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    INTERFACES z2ui5_if_app.
    DATA text TYPE string.
    DATA partly TYPE abap_bool.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS z2ui5_cl_demo_app_025 IMPLEMENTATION.
  METHOD z2ui5_if_app~main.

    text = text && ` text`.

    IF client->check_on_init( ) OR partly = abap_false.
      client->view_display( z2ui5_cl_xml_view=>factory(
        )->input( client->_bind( text )
        )->input( submit = client->_event( )
        )->checkbox( selected = client->_bind_edit( partly ) text = `partly` ) ).
    ELSE.
      client->view_model_update( ).
    ENDIF.

  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.
```
In the following illustration, you can see the difference between a full re-render and a targeted view model update:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79a8c531-b9a0-4bf4-bb1c-7d9019ef8707" width="500" />
  <br/>
  <em>You can see the difference: partly vs. not</em>
</p>

Thanks to UI5's powerful data binding mechanism, only the affected DOM elements are updated. This preserves the UI stateâ€”for example, the input focus remains intactâ€”and provides a fluid user experience. This makes UI5 a perfect team player for the HTML Over-the-Wire approach, where the ABAP backend is responsible for building both the UI structure and its dynamic state. The result is an efficient, responsive, and low-maintenance application architecture that brings the best of UI5 and ABAP together.
