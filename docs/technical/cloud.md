# Cloud Readiness

_Ready for the Future ‚Äì or Not?_

Whether it makes sense to build apps with abap2UI5 depends heavily on future-proofing. In the ABAP ecosystem, this means cloud readiness, which is closely tied to using the ABAP Cloud language version.

But what exactly does that mean? And are abap2UI5 apps truly cloud ready? Let‚Äôs take a closer look.

#### What is ABAP Cloud?

ABAP Cloud is a restricted ABAP language version that ensures cloud readiness and upgrade stability. Developments that follow the ABAP Cloud rules can run on SAP BTP ABAP Environment and SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud ABAP Environment. SAP guarantees long-term compatibility with future platform updates ‚Äî without requiring code adjustments or any further investments.

Therefore ABAP Cloud contains of a simplified technology stack, syntax, and toolset:

- No classic technologies like Web Dynpro or ALV
- Simplified syntax (e.g., no `WRITE` statements)
- Use of only released APIs ‚Äî no direct access to SAP database tables
- Development via ADT or browser-based tools, but no SAP GUI

#### Is abap2UI5 ABAP Cloud Compatible?

Yes ‚Äî abap2UI5 is fully compatible with ABAP Cloud:

- Implemented entirely using the ABAP for Cloud language version
- Uses only released SAP APIs or internally defined classes
- Requires no modifications to standard SAP code
- Frontend is a normal UI5 freestyle app  (additionaly fully compatible with the Launchpad)

abap2UI5 can be installed on SAP BTP ABAP Environment and SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud ABAP Environment (and besides that also on any on-premise system from 7.02 onward).

#### Are abap2UI5 apps Cloud Ready?

Yes and no - it depends on how the app is developed.

While the framework is cloud ready, each individual app must follow the same development principles to be considered cloud ready.

Example (cloud-ready):

```abap
test
```

Example (not cloud-ready):
```abap
test
```

So always follow cloud-ready development principles to ensure your apps are portable, upgrade-stable, and suitable for ABAP Cloud environments.

#### Do I Have to Use RAP to Be Cloud Ready?

No - RAP is not mandantory.

RAP (RESTful Application Programming Model) is SAP‚Äôs recommended model for building cloud-native applications. It is based on:
- CDS Views for data modeling
- Behavior Definitions for logic and validations
- OData Services for communication
- Fiori Elements for UI generation

abap2UI5 offers a valid alternative ‚Äî especially for developers who prefer freestyle UI5 or need lightweight apps without the full RAP stack. As long as cloud development rules are followed, both approaches are valid.

#### Conclusion

abap2UI5 is fully cloud ready and ready for the future. It enables modern, backend-driven UI5 development while remaining upgrade-safe and portable across SAP landscapes. Every app is cloud ready and can be a perfect addiotion to RAP apps already in use. For exmaple integrate them in the laucnhpad they can be used next to other RAP and UI5 freestyle apps.
