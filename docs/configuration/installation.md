# Installation

This project is compatible with most ABAP releases and language versions. As outlined in the Quickstart Guide, you can run the app directly through the HTTP handler:

### ABAP Standard

In `S/4 Private` or `S/4 On-Premise` systems you can just transport it as it is into production and use it. However it may be required to make this app accessible via BSP on-premise (leveraging the Fiori launchpad). Therefore you can install the abap2UI5 frontend:

Check out this [section](/configuration/launchpad) for more details.


### ABAP Cloud 
In `S/4 Public Cloud` or `BTP ABAP` without the authoriy `S_DEVELOP` you can not acces the HTTP endpoint, so this is not a valid scenario for producvive usage. Deploy therefor the cloud branch of the abap2UI5-frontend and maintain a new fiori launchpad:
