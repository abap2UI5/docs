# Performance

abap2UI5 is fast! Nearly everything is done in the backend, and the ABAP stack is much faster than any client or browser. Frontend logic is kept to a minimum: no loops are executed, and no extra logic is added. Everything is prepared in the backend and then directly Ã¼bergeben into the UI5 framework at the client side. abap2UI5 has been successfully tested with tables containing a large number of entries and columns. So, just develop your app, and you can assume that performance will not be an issue.<br>

### Suggestions
If you still want to optimize your app, consider the following points:
* Only call the method `client->view_display` when it is truly necessary, and prefer using `client->model_update`, this way, the UI5 framework only re-renders the controls that have actually changed.
* Use `client->bind_edit` only when users need to make changes that are processed in the backend, otherwise, it leads to unnecessary data transfer
* Use public attributes in your app class only for variables that are also displayed in the frontend, otherwise, the framework unnecessarily accesses unused values.
* Follow the usual ABAP best practices: reduce loops, use sorted tables, etc., just like with ALV in the past

### Performance Issues?
Try to minimize them and create a sample. We are happy to analyze and check if we can make abap2UI5 run even faster.
